# electronuxt-starter
Create an Electron app that serves a Nuxt.js app

## Before you get too excited
This has only been lightly tested on Linux and Mac. It almost certainly doesn't work on Windows yet(But it will)! I've also only tried it with Node v7.5.0 so far.

This is pretty much a prototype at the moment. It starts a server running inside of Electron. That server serves a Vue.js app generated by [Nuxt Express Starter](https://github.com/nuxt/express).

It's not currently very useful for the following reasons
- It's hardwired to "production" mode, meaning there's no hot-loading
- There's no rebuild command yet. Delete the nuxt/.nuxt folder and rerun `npm start` to see changes
- It was just born a few hours ago and everybody knows newborns aren't very useful, but...

## If you REALLY want to try it out...

**Install**
```
git clone https://github.com/electronuxt/electronuxt-starter
cd electronuxt-starter
npm install
npm install ./app
npm run dev
```
*Hint*: with a little luck(and 4 presses of the Enter key) you can copy/paste all the commands above at once into a terminal to get up and running with the quickness
